   - ⚠️ **MUST BE**: `BE_FusionCars`
   - This is critical!

2. **Node.js Version**:
   - Go to: Settings tab
   - Set to: `18` or `20`

3. **Start Command**:
   - Should auto-detect: `npm start`

2. Look for: **"Service URL"** or **"Domain"**
3. Copy: Your URL (looks like: `https://fusion-cars-production-env.railway.app`)

This is your **Backend API Base URL**

---

## 🎯 YOUR COMPLETE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Copy and paste these exactly into Railway Variables tab:

```
PORT
5000

NODE_ENV
production

MONGODB_URI
mongodb+srv://fusionuser:FusionPass123@fusiondb.mongodb.net/fusion-cars?retryWrites=true&w=majority

JWT_SECRET

## 🧪 VERIFY AFTER DEPLOYMENT

### Test 1: Health Check

```bash
curl https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "Server is running",
  "database": "Connected",
  "timestamp": "2024-11-08T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

✅ If you see this, backend is working!

### Test 2: Check Logs in Railway

Go to Railway Dashboard → Logs

**Look for these lines:**
```
✅ 🚀 Server is running on port 5000
✅ 🔒 CORS enabled for origins: [...]
✅ Connected to MongoDB
```

✅ No red errors should appear

### Test 3: Get All Cars

```bash
curl https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL/api/cars
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
[]  (or array of cars if you have any)
```

✅ Should return without error (200 status)

---

## 📊 YOUR API ENDPOINTS (After Deployment)

All of these will work:

```
GET  /api/health               - Server status
GET  /api/cars                 - Get all cars
POST /api/auth/login           - User login
POST /api/auth/register        - User signup
POST /api/auth/admin/login     - Admin login
GET  /api/admin/dashboard      - Admin dashboard
POST /api/bookings             - Create booking

POST /api/wishlist             - Add to wishlist
POST /api/contact              - Submit contact
```

Replace `https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL/api` with your actual Railway URL.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CHECKLIST

Before clicking Deploy, verify:

- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Root directory: `BE_FusionCars` ✅ MUST BE THIS
- [ ] Node.js version: 18 or 20
- [ ] PORT variable: `5000`
- [ ] NODE_ENV variable: `production`

- [ ] JWT_SECRET: Copied exactly (128 chars)
- [ ] FRONTEND_URL: Your Vercel URL
- [ ] ADMIN_REGISTRATION_KEY: Copied exactly (64 chars)
- [ ] CORS_ORIGIN: Set to your Vercel URL

✅ All checked? → Click Deploy!

---

## 🚨 IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### ❌ "Build Failed"
→ Check Railway logs for error message
→ Verify all 7 variables are added
→ Check MONGODB_URI format

### ❌ "Cannot Connect to MongoDB"
→ Verify MongoDB Atlas connection string
→ Check whitelist allows all IPs (0.0.0.0/0)
→ Verify username/password are correct

### ❌ "CORS Error in Frontend Console"
→ Add CORS_ORIGIN variable
→ Make sure it matches Vercel URL
→ Redeploy backend

### ❌ "/api/health returns 404"
→ Wait 2-3 minutes, backend still building
→ Check "Deployment Successful" in logs
→ Try refreshing Railway dashboard

---

## 📱 AFTER BACKEND IS LIVE

### Update Frontend with Backend URL

1. Go to: **Vercel Dashboard**
2. Click: Your `fusion-cars` frontend project
3. Go to: **Settings → Environment Variables**
4. Update: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
   ```
   Name:  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
   Value: https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL/api
   ```
5. Click: **Save**
6. Vercel: Automatically redeploys

### Test Full Integration

1. Visit: Your Vercel frontend URL
2. Check: Homepage loads without errors
3. Verify: Cars display from backend
